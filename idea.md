# Ideas
These are possible next steps.

Use `~~strike this~~` for ~~strike this~~

-------------------

* Command line, FIPS as an arg
  * Mulitple  FIPS  as  a list of args
* Make a  module/package(?) for   ipython
* Improve lookup  speed in `_select_color_based_on_percentile`
*  More  type hints
* Extract ugly function in `_get_from_tsv`
* Consider another format for caches. Arrow?
* Unit tests
* Rename `UsCountiesData` to something like `...ColorValue...`
* Put the state with the county name
* Give state and have a list of counties
* Use county names to drive program
   * If ambigious county name, give a list
* Docker container
* Flask to run
* Saving an image
* Allowing for multiple plots to be shown
* Use `fig` to avoid `plot`.  [Example from matplotlib](
https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/user_interfaces/web_application_server_sgskip.htm)
*   Make `data_breaks` a class
* Create list for `pip` to install 
* Make more things private `__`
* Better name for ~~`facebook_connects` and~~ its variables
* Make colors an enumeration for better type hints
* Use dictionary of {command: function} in REPL
* Clean up print statements around I/O
  * Add prints around write cache I/O  
* Return cmd line args in a dictionary
* ~~Use jupyter~~
* Document autoreload in jupyter
* Standard imports to begin jupyter session
* How to set up venv for jupyter
* Make Class name consistient with PEP
* Make variable consistient with PEP
* Make generic interface to link up with any values in DF
* Use absolute counts for `data_breaks`
*  Directory for jupyter
*  Src  directory 
*  Make this its own GitHub repo
*  PEP8 import sequence

DUBIOUS
* Programmaticly get fb data from web
* Programmaticly get geodata from web

DONE
* ~~Make default path for GeoData, constants in factory~~
* BAD IDEA: Use Python logging
* ~~Remove hardcoded filenames from `FacebookConnections`~~
* ~~Command line, -nocache option~~
* ~~Command line, -random option~~
* Command line, -interactive - NOT NEEDED
* ~~Delete unused columns before caching (save time and space)~~
* README.md
* ~~Make file names consistient with PEP~~
