# Ideas
These are possible next steps.

Use `~~strike this~~` for ~~strike this~~

-------------------

* ~~Command line, -nocache option~~
* ~~Command line, -random option~~
* Command line, FIPS as an arg
  * Mulitple  FIPS  as  a list of args
* Command line, -interactive
* Make a  module/package(?) for   ipython
* Improve lookup  speed in `_select_color_based_on_percentile`
*  More  type hints
* Delete unused columns before caching (save time and space)
* Extract ugly function in `_get_from_tsv`
* Remove hardcoded filenames from `FacebookConnections`
* Consider another format for caches. Arrow?
* Unit tests
* Rename `UsCountiesData` to something like `...ColorValue...`
* Put the state with the county name
* Give state and have a list of counties
* Use county names to drive program
   * If ambigious county name, give a list
* Make generic interface to link up with any values in DF
* Docker container
* Flask to run
* Saving an image
* Allowing for multiple plots to be shown
* Use `fig` to avoid `plot`.  [Example from matplotlib](
https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/user_interfaces/web_application_server_sgskip.htm)
* Do something with  `data_breaks`
* Create list for `pip` to install 
* Make more things private `__`
* Use absolute counts for `data_breaks`
* Programmaticly get fb data from web
* Programmaticly get geodata from web
* Better name for `facebook_connects` and its variables
* Make colors an enumeration for better type hints
* Use dictionary of {command: function} in REPL
* Use Python logging
* Clean up print statements around I/O
  * Add prints around write cache I/O  
* Return args in a dictionary
* ~~Make default path for GeoData, constants in factory~~
