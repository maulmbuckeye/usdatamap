This is an education project for me to learn:
* Clean code practices
* Python
* Geographical data science

If you are interested in contributing, contact me. We can learn together how to colloborate through GitHub. Right now this is just me.

Technical details are from ["How to Create United State Data Maps with Python and Matplotlib"](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-to-create-data-maps-of-the-united-states-with-python-and-matplotlib-5dfb425bd87d)

The key concept is the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Code. This is an ANSI standard used by the Census Bureau for geographical reporting.
